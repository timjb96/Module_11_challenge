# Martian Analysis: News, Weather, Conditions
# UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp Project
Skills Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Spark, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, HTML Reading, AWS

The purpose of this project was to use a webscraper via Beautiful Soup to pull Article information and data from (whatever the Url is).

The first Jupyter Notebook file uses Beautiful Soup to scrape Article information from Redplanetscience.com, specificall Article Titles and Subheadings. 
This is useful as it allows us to pull a report of the most recent bits of news about Mars quickly, and allows us to comb through the articles quicker to find an example of what kind of articles we specifically need at that time. 

The second Jupyter Notebook file uses Beautiful Soup again to pull Mars data from an Amazon AWS website, (url).
